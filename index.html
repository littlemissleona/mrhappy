            Mr Happy was always happy, but on this
            particular day he was <strong>especially happy</strong>. Can you guess why?
        </p>
        <p>
            It was Mr Happy's <strong>birthday</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr Happy decided to have a party, so he set off to invite his friends
            and buy the things he needed. First, he met Little Miss Busy. 
            <q>Good morning!</q> Mr Happy said. <q>Would you like to ...</q> 
            but Little Miss Busy was already rushing away! <strong><q>Sorry, can't stop!</q></strong> she called back.
        </p>
            <q>I suppose she's too busy to come to a party anyway,</q> said Mr Happy. 
            <q>I'll ask someone else.</q>
        <p>
            Mr Happy went to the cake shop. Mr Happy thought it would be nice to share 
            a birthday cake with his friends.

        </p>
        <p>
            But Mr Greedy was already in the shop, buying the <b>last cake. 
            <q>Sorry, can't chat!</q></b> Mr Geedy said, licking his lips as he rushed off. 
            He didn't say happy birthday to Mr Happy, but Mr Happy didn't mind. 
            <q>Not to worry,</q> said Mr Happy. <q>I'll go and get some balloons.</q>
